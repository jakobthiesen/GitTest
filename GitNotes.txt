What is git?

Version control
History etc.


When to use git?
Always use git, it is great for larger projects for file-sharing etc.




How to use:
install
create a user on
github, gitlab, gitbucket or somewhere else.
These are the services (clouds) to be used, often github is used


How to use it???

Use it through terminal, often easier.

creating a repo:
git clone
git init


git clone:
make a repo at the service used
git clone:https://depot....

SSH or HTTP can be used
SSH is often easiest when a key has been set up.


When creating a new repo at git it will guide you.



git init:
often couses problems on the first push, use clone instead.


How to add files to git??
This ofcourse requires files in the first place.

To ad a file:
git add fileName.py

If it is a python file

git add . 
This adds the complete folder, for must parts, dont use this.

git status
This gives info on your branch, up-to-date and new files etc.

If a wrong file have been added, rm can be used to remove it


Next stage is to:
commit -m "A comment here"
Commit indicates that yes, i am now ready to proceed, a comment must alway follow.
Once a commit is done, some info on file changes follows:


Pushing:
Always pull before this is done

command:
git push 




git fetch:
Get update from origin, tells you if there are updates, does not fecth them.




git pull
This command pulls what is in the cloud to your pc.




Branches:

git status will tell you what branch you are working in.

you can swtich to a branch by:
git checkout branchName

command:
git branch
this tells you where you are

git branch
git branch branchName



Pull request:
This checks if you have some conflicts, same files etc, new files new code etc.
Here you can set a reviewer, assign it to people etc.

If there are conflicts, it will tell what files are conflicting, which file would you like to keep, down to code line.



git log
this will tell what commits have been performed,
only indicates the short comments to the changes.


command:
git switch name
This switches to a branch
